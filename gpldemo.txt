This year's Underscore demo from Excess comes with full source.

The decision to give out the source for our demo engine came quite late in
the process (that is, the TG demo process -- Amoeba was originally supposed
to be released at TG, but external circumstances made this impossible,
unfortunately :-) ). Currently, there appears to be a very positive trend in the
scene world-wide. This source release is meant as a friendly gesture to that
movement, and we want to contribute to it by giving new sceners something to
learn from an look at.

After some thinking, we settled on the GNU General Public License (commonly
known as the GPL), version 2, for this project. (The full license text can be
found in the file COPYING -- if you aren't familiar with the GPL, you're
encouraged to spend half an hour reading it, it's one of the most common
"open source" licenses today.) In short, that means that you can compile the
demo, you can look at the code and learn from it, but you _can't_ grab
source from it and put it into your own closed-sourced demo, for instance --
if you want to use source directly, the derived work must also be GPL. (Note
that only the _program_ is GPLed -- the demo data is not.) However, if you
ask us, we're quite likely to make an exception -- drop us an e-mail if
you're interested.

This source isn't something we're very proud of. Basically, it's a learning
project -- personally, I went totally from scratch regarding OpenGL coding to
what you see today (the others in the group are more experienced scene-wise,
though) over the period of about a year. As a result, what you see isn't
always the result of very good design choices or clean code (especially the
opengl/ directory should go away completely, and main/ contains way too many
files), but it should nevertheless contain interesting stuff for most
democoders out there, even though some quite unclean code made its way into
the release close to deadline :-) (Releasing source can be very humbling ;-) )
It doesn't contain source for any effects we _didn't_ use in the demo
(although there aren't that many), our (partly working) GUI demo tool, our
RTG importer, our (unfinished) softsynth etc..

The prebuilt binaries included are compiled with various versions of gcc
(MingW crosscompiled from Linux for the Linux binaries), and the engine
contains only GNU Makefiles (sorry, no autoconf, you will have to tweak the
Makefiles yourself), but we've also compiled it with MSVC6 on Windows, Intel
C++ on Linux and MIPSpro on IRIX (IRIX support requires minor changes not
included, sorry). In other words, the code should be quite portable, even to
non-Intel platforms. The line endings are in UNIX format -- if your editor
can't handle it, tough luck. Conversion isn't hard anyhow.

The blob (marching cube) source was originally written by neon of
nocturnal^bafh (but later modified and optimized by us), and has been
released together with the other source with his permission.

Have fun with the source. Keep the scene spirit alive!
